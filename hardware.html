              <th>The motherboard is a circuit board that looks like a flat metal plate. Here it allows power to every computer hardware like the CPU, monitor, and RAM. It also allows the hardware to communicate with each other. Every motherboard looks different, but they all have RAM slots, CPU slots, connectors, and inputs/outputs. It is similar to our Nervous system, where it sends signals to one part of the body to another.</th>

            <th>CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, and its job is to run operating systems, run programs, and processes them (thus giving the name Processor). It looks like a small, flat, squared block. This is like the brain of the computer. Without it, the computer can't even run its OS. It's basically useless.</th>

            <th>Ram stands for Random Access Memory, and its job is to read data. For example if you open a program, it loads from the hard drive to the RAM so that is can read it much faster than the hard drive. The more GB it has, the more programs it can run without lag. If the computer has no RAM, it will still open programs but not fast and if there are multiple programs then it can crash. RAM looks like a long piece of computer chip that is installed onto the motherboard</th>
